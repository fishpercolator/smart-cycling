<section><h1>Smart Cycling: Prioritization</h1><h2 class="author">Quinn Daley</h2><img class="logo" src="img/logo.png"></section><section><h2>Problems to overcome</h2><ul><li class="fragment">Getting the info early enough</li><li class="fragment">Which direction the cyclist wants to turn</li><li class="fragment">Limit of 100 geofences on Android</li><li class="fragment">Knowing user is a cyclist and not a driver</li><li class="fragment">User experience</li><li class="fragment">Users without Android phones</li></ul></section><section><section><h2>An app design</h2><img class="featured less" src="img/app.jpg"><p>(Press space to advance, and type 's' to read notes)</p></section><section><h2>User registration</h2><img class="mockup" src="img/mockup-signup.jpg"><aside class="notes">Users will need to register to use the app. This ensures that we can 
identify users who are using the app in a problematic way (e.g. as 
drivers) and potentially ban them from the platform.</aside></section><section><h2>Pre-drawn routes</h2><img class="mockup" src="img/mockup-routes.jpg"><aside class="notes">In order to understand the direction that users are approaching from
and which way they want to turn, the app requires users to follow a
pre-entered route in a specific direction. The app should come with
several popular commuter routes pre-entered by the council. Although it
would be possible to automate the process of working out which direction
a person is approaching a signal, there's no way to know which way they
want to turn without knowing their route in advance (as we do for buses).</aside></section><section><h2>Initiating a journey</h2><img class="mockup" src="img/mockup-route.jpg"><aside class="notes">Once a user has picked a route, they can hit the start button to get 
going. The app can confirm their GPS is working and that they are near
the start location.</aside></section><section><h2>On approach to a signal</h2><img class="mockup" src="img/mockup-signal.jpg"><aside class="notes">When a user approaches a signal, it activates the geofence and sends
the appropriate data to the SmartCycling server, which in turn converts
it to UTMC and sends it on to the signal priority system. Information we
have will include the rider's location, their speed and which direction
they intend to turn (based on the current route). The app should look 
for every signal on the route, not just the next one, and assume that
each signal will only be passed once.</aside></section><section><h2>Feedback in the app</h2><img class="mockup" src="img/mockup-feedback.jpg"><aside class="notes">The app can tell people which signals it detected in time to send the
prioritization signal. This information should be generated and stored
server-side so that it can be used for analytics and fixes to broken
routes.</aside></section><section><h2>Auto-ending journey</h2><img class="mockup" src="img/mockup-done.jpg"><aside class="notes">If the user passes the last signal, or doesn't pass a signal for a set
time (e.g. 1 hour) then it could mark the route as complete. Users
could also have a stop button.</aside></section><section><h2>Record mode</h2><img class="mockup" src="img/mockup-record.jpg"><aside class="notes">Adding new routes should be possible with a "record mode". This could
record which signals a user passes while cycling a new route, and then
present them with a list of all signals. Maybe it could assume 
"straight ahead" for all of them as auto-detecting the direction would
be hard for a small-scale app.</aside></section><section><h2>Manually editing journeys</h2><img class="mockup" src="img/mockup-edit.jpg"><aside class="notes">Then users can go in and remove inaccurately detected signals, and 
change the direction at signals where they are actually going left or
right. There would need to be a UI that is aware of all the signal and
movement codes.</aside></section></section><section><h2>Technical details</h2><ul><li class="fragment">Set up Android geofences when journey begins</li><li class="fragment">Send message to SmartCycling server when entering geofence</li><li class="fragment">Message converted to RTIG-UTMC format including "movement"</li><li class="fragment">App needs to be aware of signal IDs and movement IDs</li><li class="fragment">App can use ActivityRecognitionClient to identify drivers looking to abuse priority</li></ul></section><section><h2>Smallest first step</h2><ul><li class="fragment">Identify popular route</li><li class="fragment">Hardcode that route in both directions</li><li class="fragment">Need signal / movement IDs and geofence radius</li><li class="fragment">Build app with just start/stop and route choice</li><li class="fragment">No feedback / editing</li></ul></section><section><h2>Thanks!</h2><img class="featured" src="img/bike.jpg"></section>
